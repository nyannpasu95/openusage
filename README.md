## Download

[**Download the latest release**](https://github.com/nyannpasu95/ohmyusage/releases/latest) (macOS, Apple Silicon & Intel)

The app auto-updates. Install once and you're set.

> **First launch:** builds are not notarized by Apple, so macOS will block the app with a malware warning. To open it, run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OhMyUsage.app` in Terminal, or go to System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway" after the first blocked attempt.

## What It Does

OhMyUsage lives in your menu bar and shows you how much of your AI coding subscriptions you've used. Progress bars, badges, and clear labels. No mental math required.

- **One glance.** All your AI tools, one panel.
- **Always up-to-date.** Refreshes automatically on a schedule you pick.
- **Follows active usage.** The menu bar switches to the subscription whose usage just increased.
- **Global shortcut.** Toggle the panel from anywhere with a customizable keyboard shortcut.
- **Lightweight.** Opens instantly, stays out of your way.
- **Plugin-based.** New providers get added without updating the whole app.
- **[Local HTTP API](docs/local-http-api.md).** Other apps can read your usage data from `127.0.0.1:6736`.
- **[Proxy support](docs/proxy.md).** Route provider HTTP requests through a SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy.

## Open Source, Community Driven

OhMyUsage is built by its users. Hundreds of people use it daily, and the project grows through community contributions: new providers, bug fixes, and ideas.

I maintain the project as a guide and quality gatekeeper, but this is your app as much as mine. If something is missing or broken, the best way to get it fixed is to contribute by opening an issue, or submitting a PR.

Plugins are currently bundled as we build out the API, but soon will be made flexible so you can build and load your own.

<summary><strong>Build from source</strong></summary>

> **Warning**: The `tikuwa` branch is the active development branch and may not be stable. Users are advised to use tagged versions for stable builds. Tagged versions are fully tested while `tikuwa` may contain unreleased features.

### Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend:** Rust, Tauri v2
- **Plugins:** JavaScript (QuickJS sandbox), one folder per provider under `plugins/`
- **Package manager:** [Bun](https://bun.sh)

### Prerequisites

- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) stable toolchain
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

### Build & run

```bash
bun install          # install dependencies
bun tauri dev        # run the app in development
bun tauri build      # produce a release build (DMG + .app)
```

Plugin sources live under `plugins/`. The `beforeDevCommand` / `beforeBuildCommand` hooks copy each plugin's manifest, declared entry script, and declared icon into `src-tauri/resources/bundled_plugins/`; test files stay out of the app bundle.

To run the test suites:

```bash
bun run test         # frontend + plugin tests (Vitest)
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml   # Rust tests
cargo clippy --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
